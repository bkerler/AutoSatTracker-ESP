<h3>Introduction</h3>
In December 1983 OSCAR NEWS published my program listing "OSCAR10.BAS" 
[1]. In heavily commented style it documented the basic routines one 
needs to build up a satellite tracking program.  It must have been 
popular, since for some while it was the most requested back issue of 
O.N., and has formed the basis of many other authors' software (for 
example SATSCAN, VECSAT and parts of RealTrak for the IBM-PC, !ArcTrack 
for the Archimedes, the SATTRACK III Antenna/Radio Controller and 
numerous private programs).
<p>
In time the program accumulated several other modules, with the 
mathematics described in interim O.N. articles.  When issued for the BBC
 micro the program acquired the name "PLAN10", and later "PLAN13", and 
it's been transcribed for several other machines including the IBM-PC 
and Commodore 64 etc.
</p><p>
In recent years or so my mail has featured more and more queries about 
tracking matters than was usual.  The flavour of these suggests that a 
new generation of satellite enthusiasts is emerging and are rightly 
asking the old questions anew.
</p><p>
So for a long while I've been intending to re-publish these routines, 
but in their most up-to-date embodiment.  Hence this pamphlet.  I don't 
intend to provide 100% mathematical details. To do so means essentially 
writing the whole program out anyway, and references are plentiful.
</p><p>
Old hands will recognise the coding style.  Additions include the Sun's 
position, eclipses, visibility, Sun angle, sub-satellite point, mode 
switching, date algorithms and direct range-rate calculations for 
doppler shift.
</p><p>
Almost every publication to do with satellites has information about orbits and their properties.  For general reading <i>The Satellite Experimenter's Handbook</i> [2] is unsurpassed, and itself documents several hundred references. <i>Fundamentals of Astrodynamics</i> [3] is a no-nonsense text that's full of insights, and is incredibly cheap.
</p><p>
<a href="http://celestrak.com/NORAD/documentation/spacetrk.pdf">Models for the Propagation of NORAD Element Sets</a>
 [4] documents five ways to use a set of keps properly.  SGP, the 
simplest model, runs to 4 pages of higher mathematics just to compute 
satellite position and velocity.  All amateur implementations (i.e. 
lines 2000-2210 of PROCsatvec) use only the first half page of this, 
skipping the long term perturbatory effects.  <a href="https://www.amsat.org/amsat/articles/g3ruh/112.html">Sun's Up</a> [5]  is about modelling the Sun's position, and describes applications including illumination and eclipses. <a href="https://www.amsat.org/amsat/articles/g3ruh/100.html">30.6 days Hath September</a> [6] documents date algorithms. <i>The Astronomical Almanac</i> [7] is invaluable for checking calculations; an annual, but useful for many years.
</p><p>
Surprisingly when OSCAR10.BAS was published there were complaints that 
"filling Oscar News with programs was a waste of space" etc etc.  My 
reply to this myopic view was, and remains:
</p><p>
<i>"The program was designed to be more than a mere listing to be 
blindly typed in and run.  It is a treatise giving all the equations for
 solving the elliptic orbit and related problems.  To do this, as well 
as provide a tool suitable for immediate use the program was written in a
 quasi-algebraic style.  Variable names were chosen to be meaningful, 
there are copious comments, and routines are written so that users can 
adapt them as they wish.  However the published arrangement is not the 
only one. The program is a clear formulation of the general satellite 
orbit problem, and is sure to provide the interested amateur with 
several months of absorbing self-training material".</i>   Plunder!  Enjoy!

</p><h3>About vectors</h3>
Manipulations use vectors throughout.  While spherical trigonometry 
could also be used, it tends to be very clumsy and invariably obscures 
the mechanics. Angles are fine for human oriented input/output, but in 3
 dimensional analyses, vectors have no equal.  In the satellite position
 problem vectors are used to represent distances, directions and 
velocities, and are in <b>bold</b>.  All have 3 components.  They may be
 added or subtracted provided they are in the same units, and may also 
be multiplied.  The golden rule is that any vectors so combined <i>must</i>
 be specified in the same coordinate system.  In fact much of any 
satellite calculation program is concerned with ensuring just that.

<i>Amsat day numbers are reckoned from 0 = 1978 Jan 01; AP is argument 
of perigee; ALON/ALAT are the satellite's attitude; SAZ/SEL are Sun's 
position in the orbit plane, and ILL is solar panel illumination.  MA is
 mean anomaly in units of 256 per orbit.  SQ is squint angle, RR is 
range rate (km/s), ECL? will indicate if the satellite is in eclipse, or
 whether it is potentially visible.  HGT is height (km), and SLAT SLON 
are sub-satellite latitude and longitude (deg East).</i>

</p><h3>Program Notes</h3>
After initialisation ("init") the program prompts you for a start date and
duration of run, then sets up day, hour and minute loops to call the routines
"satvec", "rangevec", "sunvec" and "printdata".
<p>
PROCinit (lines 1000-1840): All the constants needed by the routines are
established here.  Most relate to a physical quantity, but are then combined
with others or need units changing to form a derived quantity. Some of these
constants are only used transiently within "init" itself, but are included for
clarity.
</p><p>
PROCsatvec (lines 2000-2430): Takes input variables day (DN) and fraction of
day (TN) and computes satellite position, velocity and antenna direction in
orbit plane coordinates. These are then output in celestial coordinates and
geocentric coordinates.
</p><p>
PROCrangevec (lines 4000-4200): Calculates Range vector from satellite and
observer vector, and derives range, azimuth, elevation, squint, range rate and
sub-satellite point.
</p><p>
PROCsunvec  (lines 3000-3260): Computes Sun's position in celestial
coordinates, and then Sun angle, illumination, visibility and eclipse details.
Actual visibility also depends on brightness of satellite, and darkness of sky.
</p><p>
FNday(Y,M,D)  Function returns a general day number from year, month and day.
Value is Julian Day - 1721409.5  or  Amsat day + 722100
</p><p>
FNdate(DN)  Function converts day number to a string, e.g. 1990 Nov 3 [Sat]
</p><p>
FNatn(Y,X)  Crash-proof four quadrant arctangent.  Returns value in range 0-2pi

<h3>Coordinate Systems</h3>
A number of rectangular 3-D XYZ coordinate systems are used in the program,
viz:  Celestial,  Geocentric,  Orbit plane.   Definitions:
<br> <b>Celestial:</b>  System fixed with respect to the stars.  XY plane coincident with Earth's equator.
<br> Origin: centre of the Earth.
<br> X: Directed towards the First point in Aries (Right Ascension = 0)
<br> Y: 90 degrees East around the equator (RA = 90)
<br> Z: Directed towards the North pole
<br>
<br> <b>Geocentric:</b>  System as celestial, but fixed to the Earth;  related via Greenwich Hour Angle Aries (GHAA).
<br> Origin: centre of the Earth.
<br> X: Directed to intersection of Equator and Greenwich meridian (Longitude = 0)
<br> Y: 90 degrees East around the Earth's Equator (Longitude =  90E)
<br> Z: Directed towards the North pole
<br>
<br> <b>Orbit Plane:</b> Fixed (almost) with respect to the stars, in orientation defined by argument of perigee, inclination and RAAN.
<br> Origin: Earth's centre.
<br> X: Directed towards perigee
<br> Y: 90 degrees from perigee round the orbit in direction of satellite's motion
<br> Z: Perpendicular to orbit plane

<h3>Additional Notes</h3>
<b>Orbit Plane -&gt; Celestial Coordinate Transformation</b>
<p>
In earlier versions of the program, the conversion of a vector from 
Orbit plane coordinates to Celestial coordinates was written out stage 
by stage. That is, a rotation in argument of perigee, followed by a 
rotation through inclination, and finally through RAAN.  Since there are
 actually several vectors (satellite position, velocity and antenna 
axis) to transform, this became a little clumsy, so the three rotations 
are now amalgamated into one. The array [C] that does this is computed 
at lines 2260-2290.
</p><p>
<b>Celestial -&gt; Orbit Plane Coordinate Transformation</b>
</p><p>
The array [C] can also be used in the reverse direction, to convert a 
vector from Celestial to Orbit plane coordinates.  This is done by 
"transposing the array", using C(J,I) for C(I,J) throughout.  This is 
used to calculate the Sun's position as seen from the orbit plane (lines
 3210-3240).
</p><p>
<b>Decay</b>
</p><p>
The Keplerian element DECAY is half the rate of change of mean motion.  
DECAY is usually very small, of order 10^-7, and its short term 
influence is small. For example, MA is affected by an amount DECAY*T*T 
over T days.  Over 100 days that makes 10^-7*100*100 = 0.001 
revolutions, or about 7.2 seconds for a 2 hour period satellite.
</p><p>
Decay is only really significant for low altitude satellites such as the
 space shuttle, ISS, or satellites nearing burn-up.  Then the value can 
be as large as 10^-4.  This causes in addition a noticeable second order
 effect on semi-major axis, argument of perigee and RAAN.  The program 
accounts for this with terms calculated at line 2030.
</p><p>
For many purposes, especially if the Keplerian elements are regularly 
updated, drag can be ignored.  This is true in particular for Oscar-13, 
where the unmodelled luni-solar perturbations are substantially larger 
than "decay".
</p><p>
<b>Doppler Shift</b>
</p><p>
The program calculates range-rate RR (line 4190)  in km/s.  If a 
satellite transmits a frequency FT, then this is received as a frequency
 FR:<br>
 FR = FT * (1 - RR/299792). [Note: 299792 is the speed of light in km/s]
</p><p>
Thus the "doppler shift" FD is given by:   FD = -FT*RR/299792.
</p><p>
The calculation of range-rate is accurate in vacuo.  However, at low 
elevations the radio path through the Earth's atmosphere is not 
perfectly straight.  This refraction causes the actual observed doppler 
shift at AOS and LOS to be as much as 1 part in 10^7 in error, say 
50-100 Hz at 435 MHz.  It should also be noted that simple crystal 
oscillators have a similar order of stability, and satellites usually 
experience large temperature changes.
</p><p>
<b>Footprint</b>
</p><p>
In some programs there is a requirement to draw a circle around the sub-
 satellite point to indicate the field of view of the satellite.  The 
following routine indicates how to do this.  It is coded for clarity, 
not for speed.  It would be better to store SIN(A) and COS(A) in a table
 rather than compute them every call.  Since the footprint is left-right
 symmetric, only one half of the circle's points need be computed, and 
the other half can be inferred logically.
</p><p>
The sub-routine's output is a unit vector {X,Y,Z} in geocentric 
coordinates for the I'th point on the Earth's surface.  This will then 
need transforming to map coordinates (mercator, spherical, linear or 
whatever), and then screen coordinates to suit the computer.

<p>
<b>Squint Angle</b>
</p><p>
Squint (or pointing) angle is the angle between the spacecraft's antenna
 and the observer.  This is calculated at line 4120 for Oscar-13's 
high-gain antennas.  As the low gain antennas are simple monopoles 
radiating normal to the <b>a</b> axis, low-gain squint is given by:

</p><pre>SQ_low_gain = 90 - SQ_high_gain   (deg)</pre>

Some satellites are stabilised so that they are continuously Earth 
pointing (e. g. UOSATs).  For these, the antenna axis unit vector is 
aligned with the spacecraft's position vector, i.e. <b>a = -s </b>  So to calculate the squint angle for these satellites use the formula:

<pre>4120 SQ = DEG(ACS( (Sx*Rx + Sy*Ry + SZ*Rz)/RS ))   (deg)</pre>

<b>Sun Model and Sidereal Constants</b>
<p>
The calculations of Earth rotation and Sun position are the most accurate part
of this program!  There is no need to update the solar constants at lines
1630-1660 for several decades.
